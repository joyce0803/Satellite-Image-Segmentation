## Detecting Buildings And Non Buildings From Satellite Images Using U-Net ##
This project presents the implementation of the research paper titled "Detecting Buildings and Non-Buildings from Satellite Images Using U-Net" authored by Waleed Alsabhan, Turky Alotaiby, and Basil Dudin. 
The primary objective of this project is to put into practice the knowledge and insights gained from the research paper into an application and provide a practical solution for the crucial task of detecting buildings and non-buildings in satellite images. 
The implementation of this paper is motivated by the inherent challenges in manually extracting buildings from satellite images, which is both laborious and time-consuming. 
By adopting an accurate and automated building detection technique using the U-Net architecture, this project aims to showcase the architecture's ability to accurately identify and outline buildings in satellite images. 
This will provide a quick, reliable, and efficient way to identify and map buildings in such images. 
The project involves training the U-Net model on a dataset consisting of satellite images and their corresponding masks. After training, the model achieves exceptional accuracy and excels at handling complex shapes and patterns prevalent in satellite images. 
This model can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of various applications, including urban planning, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
